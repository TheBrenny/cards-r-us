## Scratch Pad

- [ ] When a player is added/removed, offset all cards by the difference in offsetAngle on the server side, and resend all card states
- [ ] Don't allow players to move "moving:true" cards if they're not the culprit of them (stop card stealing)
- [ ] Take advantage of touch events somehow!
